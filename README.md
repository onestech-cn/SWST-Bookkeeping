## Client Diligence
SWST FIL+ implements a comprehensive client verification and onboarding process to ensure all participants are legitimate and trustworthy:

1. **Client Verification and Initial Trust Establishment**
   - **Individuals**: Government-issued ID, name, address, and social media validation
   - **Organizations**: Business license, registration certificate, country of incorporation, executive profiles
   - **Enterprise Clients**: Certificate of incorporation, business authorization letter (signed by CEO or board member), and clear explanation of data relevance to Filecoin use cases
   - **Social Footprint Analysis**: Official website, GitHub, LinkedIn, WeChat, or Twitter

2. **Sybil Attack Mitigation**
   - Clients are verified using a trusted third-party KYC/KYB tool (e.g., Toggle) including biometric checks, ID verification, and IP/device fingerprinting
   - Consistent and unique Slack/GitHub/email identity required across submissions
   - Internal checks include IP address patterns, hosting overlap, cross-client GitHub associations, and rejection of shell companies or clients with ambiguous ownership

3. **Enterprise Data Ownership Validation**
   - Clients provide signed data ownership statements or license agreements
   - Supporting evidence includes data source metadata, public URLs, origin system logs, and internal documentation
   - Minimum 20% of requested dataset submitted as a sample for inspection

4. **Audit Readiness**
   - All diligence records are stored in the public bookkeeping repository: [SWST Bookkeeping](https://github.com/onestech-cn/SWST-Bookkeeping)
   - Records include KYC/KYB documents, data ownership declarations, sample data validation logs, on-chain deal evidence, and client activity reports

## Description of Data Diligence
SWST FIL+ performs thorough data diligence to ensure datasets meet program scope, legal requirements, and ownership validation:

1. **Scope and Quality Verification**
   - Clients submit detailed dataset information: type, format, origin, and intended use
   - 20â€“30% of data sampled based on size to assess completeness, usability, and format consistency
   - Prevents sector-filling, corrupted, or unusable data from receiving DataCap

2. **Legal and Regional Compliance**
   - Clients provide compliance declarations and supporting documentation (e.g., GDPR for EU, PIPL for China)
   - Automated scanning tools supplement manual reviews
   - Global legal database ensures up-to-date adherence; complex cases reviewed with legal counsel

3. **Data Ownership Verification**
   - Signed ownership statements mandatory
   - Metadata, system logs, or third-party authorization letters used for validation
   - Independent audits possible for high-value or sensitive datasets

4. **Data Sampling and Content Integrity**
   - Stratified random CID sampling performed per allocation round using tools like SPARK and Lassie
   - AI-driven content analysis (fingerprinting, duplication detection) detects filler or tampered data
   - >5% flagged data triggers mandatory re-verification and governance reporting

5. **Auditability and Transparency**
   - Evidence packages include KYB records, CID logs, screenshots, test results, and on-chain deal metadata
   - Automated audit reports consolidate compliance and anomaly metrics
   - All data and guidance publicly available at [SWST Bookkeeping](https://github.com/onestech-cn/SWST-Bookkeeping)
