    "Brief history of your project and organization": "The Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) created by the Global Land Analysis and Discovery Lab (GLAD) at the University of Maryland serves as a spatially and temporally consistent input for land cover mapping and change detection at global to local scales. The GLAD ARD represents a 16-day time series of globally consistent, tiled Landsat normalized surface reflectance from 1997 to the present operationally updated every 16 days. Only data from 2020 to present available on the AWS, older data is available through the UMD API. The Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) laboratory in the Department of Geographical Sciences at the University of Maryland investigates methods, causes and impacts of global land surface change. Earth observation imagery are the primary data source and land cover extent and change the primary topic of interest. The lab is led by Dr. Matthew Hansen. The team consists of full-time researchers, post-docs and doctoral students with diverse backgrounds.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
    "Describe the data being stored onto Filecoin": "The Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) created by the Global Land Analysis and Discovery team (GLAD) serves as a spatially and temporally consistent input for land cover mapping and change detection at global to local scales. The [GLAD ARD](https://glad.umd.edu/ard/home#format) represents a 16-day time series of globally consistent, tiled Landsat normalized surface reflectance from 1997 to the present operationally updated every 16 days.

    "Where was the data currently stored in this dataset sourced from": "AWS Cloud",
    "How do you plan to prepare the dataset": "We conducted secondary development based on: https://github.com/ipld/go-car.   we download the data according to the AWS command line. After downloading, we use the open source go-car of the ipld team to cut it into small files of a specified size. The csv file will store the piece_cid and size information corresponding to the source file.",
    "Please share a sample of the data (a link to a file, an image, a table, etc., are good ways to do this.)": "aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://glad.landsat.ard/data/tiles/ --recursive",
    "Confirm that this is a public dataset that can be retrieved by anyone on the network (i.e., no specific permissions or access rights are required to view the data)": "[x] I confirm",
    "What is the expected retrieval frequency for this data": "Yearly",
    "For how long do you plan to keep this dataset stored on Filecoin": "1 to 1.5 years",
    "In which geographies do you plan on making storage deals": "Greater China, Asia other than Greater China",
    "How will you be distributing your data to storage providers": "Cloud storage (i.e. S3)",
    "Please list the provider IDs and location of the storage providers you will be working with. Note that it is a requirement to list a minimum of 5 unique provider IDs, and that your client address will be verified against this list in the future": "f03645007 \nf03644142 \nf03645884 \nf03645883 \nf03645885",
    "Can you confirm that you will follow the Fil+ guideline (Data owner should engage at least 4 SPs and no single SP ID should receive >30% of a client's allocated DataCap)": "Yes"
